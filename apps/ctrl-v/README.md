# CTRL + V

Idk what is this so...

## Project Setup

Make sure to run `pnpm install` in the root directory.

```sh
# /web
pnpm install
```

## Dev Mode

This monorepo uses [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo) to run only this app in dev mode. Just run the following command:

```sh
# /web
pnpm dev --filter=ctrl-v
```
